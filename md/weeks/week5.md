# EDA/Pandas

1. Re-visit the BABS data set and think about how you would analyze it
   for a different purpose than we saw in the classroom. What would
   change? What would be similar.
2. What kind of data could the BABS set be combined with?
3. So far, we've seen a number of data sets (and sources) in the
   class.
     - Google trends.
     - Web scraping.
     - Twitter.
     - Combined cycle power plant.
     
   Find a non-obvious domain where each of these data sets could be
   helpful for. An application in a non-obvious domain for the BABS
   data would e.g. be using it for health care instead of
   transportation.
