# Natural Language Processing

1. Play around with `NLTK`. It's a fantastic package with a lot of
   functionality.
2. Write a function to extract bigrams from text, returning only those
   that don't incude words occuring in a set of stopwords passed to
   the function.
3. Write a function that, given a corpus of text and a number of
   stopwords, returns the n most common bigrams not containing the
   given stopwords and their counts.
4. Write a function that, given a corpus of text, make a pandas data
   frame that contains binary columns indicating presence of a set of
   bigrams in each of the corpus' texts.
5. Write a function that, given a corpus of positive and negatve
   texts, makes a classifier that will predict positive or negative
